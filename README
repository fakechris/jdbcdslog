What is jdbcdslog-exp?

jdbcdslog-exp is an experimental fork of jdbcdslog that:
- more directly fill SQL statement (you can copy it to the tool like Oracle's SQL Developer and can be used directly)
- can use a configurable SQL formatter
- can be configured to display elapsed time
- is available in the maven central repository
- supports Java 5 and above (you need to understand that the project should compile with jdk 1.5)
(Of course, the original function does not change!)


jdbcdslog - The goal of the project is to create a high-performance and easy to use tool for the SQL queries logging for JDBC applications.

Features include:
- can be attached on Connection, Driver or DataSource(XA,Pooling) levels (the last was my main motivation to start this project)
- can log bind parameters for PreparedStatement and CallableStatement calls
- can log result of queries from ResultSet objects
- can log queries execution time
- can detect slow queries
- logging engine agnostic (thanks to SLF4J, you can use most of popular logging libraries like log4j, apache common logging, java logging or simple printing to System.out)
- can log calling method stack trace.
