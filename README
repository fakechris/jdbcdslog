What is jdbcdslog-exp?

jdbcdslog-exp is an experimental fork of jdbcdslog that:
- more directly fill SQL statement (you can copy it to the tool like Oracle's SQL Developer and can be used directly)
- can use a configurable SQL formatter
- can be configured to display elapsed time
- is available in the maven central repository
- supports Java 5 and above (you need to understand that the project should compile with jdk 1.5)
(Of course, the original function does not change!)
